					<h2 class="top">To Make a Report</h2>
					<p>You may use either of the following two methods to submit a report:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Select the <strong>"Make a Report"</strong> link at the top of this web page.</li>
						<li class="listor">OR</li>
						<li>Dial toll-free, within the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico and Canada: <span class="nowrap" id="epDDN"></span></li>
					</ul>
					<p>After you complete your report you will be assigned a unique code called a "report key." Write down your report key and password and keep them in a safe place. After <strong class="nowrap">5-6</strong> business days, use your report key and password to check your report for feedback or questions.</p>

					<h1 class="top">Our Commitment</h1>
					<p>Colleagues,</p>
					<p>High ethics and integrity are very important to Mt. San Antonio College.  We want to do everything possible to maintain a positive image in our community.  The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants states that one of the most important steps in protecting any organization from fraud is to provide a mechanism for reporting fraud and unethical practices.  In fact, public companies are required by law to provide a reporting mechanism.  Fraud hotlines have proven to be a powerful and cost-effective loss prevention tool for organizations using them.</p>
					<p>Therefore, we have established an <strong>anonymous</strong> reporting mechanism for you to report suspected fraud.  We have subscribed to ethicspoint which is operated by an outside agency, not by internal staff.  This service provides a toll-free telephone number <strong>(1-866-367-7970)</strong>, and a web site <a href="https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/54937/index.html">https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/54937/index.html</a>, for you to submit <strong>anonymous alerts</strong> to well-trained Certified Fraud Examiners.</p>
					<p>We strongly urge you to support this program.  We all play an important role in protecting the assets of our College.  The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimates that organizations can lose up to 6% of annual revenues due to fraud.  If you suspect inappropriate use of College funds or resources, please report them immediately.  Don’t hesitate to report a suspected activity even if you believe the dollar amount to be small.</p>
					<p>Thank you for doing your part to protect the integrity of Mt. San Antonio College.  We take pride in making Mt. San Antonio College a highly ethical, professional, and fraud-free organization.</p>
