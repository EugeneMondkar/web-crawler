SAC to starting their wildly successful court reporting business, identical twin sisters Whitney Kumar and Kamryn Villegas are typical Mountie alumnae, which of course means they are anything but typical. Erica has been supervising the WIN for twenty years now, and she can’t imagine doing anything else with her life. Bryce and Jerrica (née Morales) Gordon both grew up in the Mt. SAC area and were drawn to the school because of its aviation program. Bryce wanted to be a pilot, and Jerrica was a budding aviation fan. Neither could have guessed how much the College would impact both their personal and professional lives. I work as a software engineer at Microsoft in Seattle. When it came time for dancer Dove Dellos-Kilde to choose a college back in 1996, she intended to earn a business degree while pursuing her true passion—dance—on the side. She had no idea that at Mt. SAC, she’d find a dance family she’d carry with her for the rest of her life. During the stay home circumstances dictated by the COVID-19 public health crisis, artists of all kinds are finding innovative ways to continue their crafts and share their talents with the world. Mt. SAC alumna Lia Booth is no different. I provide HR support to Aircraft Maintenance throughout the Western United States. Prior to attending the program at Mt. SAC I was in a career field that I had no passion for, which can take a toll on a person. Attending this program put me on the path of turning a lifelong love of commercial aviation into a career. Chief Bertelsen is also a strong supporter of community outreach efforts by law enforcement. He believes it is absolutely necessary for the Azusa Police Department to have strong partnerships with the community. That two African-American sisters from Diamond Bar, California would both end up working as TV writers on shows we’ve actually heard of like Criminal Minds and How to Get Away With Murder is unlikely, but it happened for Kim and Erika Harrison. Of course, their story started at Mt. SAC.

Financial Aid Financial Aid is intended to help students who might not otherwise be able to attend college. Although the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and his/her family, it is recognized that many families have limited resources and are unable to meet the cost of a college education. Financial Aid programs have been established to provide assistance for students with documented financial need. In achieving this goal, the aid office must evaluate the family's financial ability to pay for educational costs in order to distribute limited resources in a fair and equitable manner. The mission of the Financial Aid Office is to provide equitable access to higher education and the timely delivery of student aid funds through our commitment to empower students and their families to achieve personal, professional, and academic success by removing financial barriers and providing premier service.

New Parking Structures: Mostly Empty & with EV Charging October 04, 2021 - 04:20 PM Students now have two mostly empty parking structures to use, on the south side of Temple Ave. on Bonita Dr., and 59 EV (electric vehicle) car charging stations they may use for free in those structures. The structures are both located off Bonita Dr. on the south side of Temple Ave. “Since coming down here, I have spent zero dollars on gas,“ said Aviation student Noah Lehman, who moved from Santa Cruz to attend Mt. SAC. Lehman had an SUV that he sold to buy the plug-in hybrid he now uses in Southern California. Lehman said using the charging stations is incredibly easy. “You just download the app onto your phone and scan it, and then plug in your car. It takes about 30 extra seconds. Plus, these are fast chargers.” Although a student, staff or day use ($4) parking permit is required to use the two parking structures, the EV charging stations are free to use only for students and employees of Mt. SAC. Students and employees may charge their vehicles for up to four hours a day. While availability of parking (or lack thereof) is commonly one of the primary grievances of students to Mt. SAC, these two structures are still mostly empty. This is thought by staff to be because students still do not know about them and lower in-person enrollment, due to the pandemic driving students to online classes or delaying their education altogether until the pandemic ends. But for the students who are using them, they could not be happier. Hear from them in this video about the return of students to the campus. The Champion Structure (or Lot R), which stands next to the Hilmer Lodge Stadium, is now complete and in full use, with new tennis courts and more parking sharing the top level. The Gateway Structure (or Lot S ) is located on the southwest corner of Temple Ave. and Bonita Dr. All levels of that structure are currently in use; however, construction is still being done on the structure. A covered bridge will take students from the structure, over Temple Ave. and into a new Transit Center that is being built on the north side of the street. Another bridge is also under construction to take students over Bonita Dr. to the new Gym and Aquatic Center, which are currently under construction. Since the elevators in Gateway are not yet in use, the first floor of that structure is currently reserved for handicapped parking. Except for the top levels of the two structures, the parking in them is completely covered and will keep cars cool on sunny days and dry on rainy ones. The structures are rarely more than half full at any given time, with Champion currently seeing more use from athletes and Kinesiology students. The Gateway Structure is frequently quite empty on levels 2-4. On a Wednesday late in the morning, the only car on the entire third floor was an electric one using an EV charging station.

In Pandemic, Hundreds of Students Still Come from Abroad September 29, 2021 - 12:02 AM Despite the difficulty in overseas travel, more than 300 international students have come from abroad to attend Mt. SAC in-person this Fall. As expected, COVID-19, and the restrictions and guidelines surrounding international travel, have dipped the numbers this school year, but perhaps not nearly as much as one might expect. The International Student Center held a Welcome Carnival for these on-campus students from such distant locales as Myanmar and the Ivory Coast. The Carnival was a meet and greet for International Students to get to know each other in hopes they help support one another with the cultural, language and educational challenges they will face traveling so far from home to attend college. The most popular destination from which Mt. SAC draws students is China, and the most popular major for international students is Business, according to Christopher Dickson, the new Director of the International Student Program. All over campus, in a wide array of majors, students from a diverse number of countries, such as Indonesia, Taiwan, India, and Brazil are studying hard to take advantage of the cache that an American education holds within the global job market. “Having a degree from an American institution holds weight and is very marketable,” Dickson said. “A community college like Mt. SAC is seen worldwide as a great way to segue to an American four-year university. Plus, it costs significantly less, so they are saving money transferring to them instead.” The Carnival invites campus clubs to host games for the students in order to get them to join and be more involved in college social life. The idea is to develop a sense of community and belonging in students who otherwise may feel a bit alienated on such a large campus in a foreign country. But building a sense of community goes both ways for the International Student Program, said Dickson, “Our signature event each year is the International Fair during the International Education Week in November.” At the upcoming fair, international students will host informational booths about their countries for purposes of cultural exchange and appreciation. This educates other students about their culture, while at the same time building awareness of the large international presence on the campus, Dickson said. Learn more about the International Student Program at their website.

75th Anniversary Diamond Jubilee to be held Oct. 8 September 23, 2021 - 01:18 PM Mt. SAC is inviting its faculty, staff, students, and the neighboring communities to a Diamond Jubilee - a celebration of the College’s 75th anniversary on Friday, Oct. 8 at 5:30 p.m. at the brand new Hilmer Lodge Stadium. On September 16, 1946, Mt. San Antonio College opened for classes for the first time, leading the community in its recovery after World War II. Almost exactly 75 years later, Mt. SAC is again leading the community as they reopen classes and services through the pandemic. "Now, more than ever, it’s important that we take time to pause and celebrate this momentous occasion," said Mt. SAC President and CEO, Dr. William Scroggins. Kicking off at 5:30 p.m. in the new Hilmer Lodge Stadium, the outdoor event allows attendees to play sports-themed carnival games, relax to some live music, enjoy the family-friendly movie “Book of Life” under the stars, and more. Admission and activities are free, including the games, movie, cotton candy and popcorn. Additional food options will be available for purchase. The first 750 attendees will receive a free commemorative picnic blanket to use on the beautiful new football field while watching the movie. Visitors who sign up with the Mt. SAC Foundation at the event will also receive a stadium cushion. For more information, please visit www.mtsac.edu/75.

Assessment and Placement The assessment and placement process has been established to enable all students an opportunity to achieve probable success along their academic pathway. The college will no longer utilize a placement test to determine students’ readiness for English, math, and reading courses. High school information and/or other measures will be used to determine appropriate course placement. Students have the right to access transfer-level English, math, and reading courses. Non-Native Speakers may select to take credit English as a Second Language (ESL) courses. Most students will complete an online tool called the Assessment Questionnaire (AQ) and will receive recommendations for enrolling into English, math, and reading courses based on an assessment utilizing multiple measures. The AQ is not a test. Students will be asked to provide information about the English and math courses they took in high school and their grades in those courses as well as their cumulative grade point average. Students who complete the AQ will be eligible for the following. Math Guidance Video English Guidance Video Helpful Links: 1100 N.

Financial Aid Financial Aid is intended to help students who might not otherwise be able to attend college. Although the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and his/her family, it is recognized that many families have limited resources and are unable to meet the cost of a college education. Financial Aid programs have been established to provide assistance for students with documented financial need. In achieving this goal, the aid office must evaluate the family's financial ability to pay for educational costs in order to distribute limited resources in a fair and equitable manner. The mission of the Financial Aid Office is to provide equitable access to higher education and the timely delivery of student aid funds through our commitment to empower students and their families to achieve personal, professional, and academic success by removing financial barriers and providing premier service.

Police and Campus Safety General Parking Information Student Parking: Faculty and Staff Parking Special Parking Areas STUDENT PARKING PERMITS A Parking Permit is required & parking regulations are enforced in all Student Lots during Fall, Spring, Winter and Summer sessions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Student Permits are valid only in Student Lots. Only during the first two weeks of the Fall and Spring semesters, and during the first week of the Summer and Winter intersessions, a student parking permit is not required in the Student Parking Lots. However, fees ARE required in Metered parking stalls, as stated in the Parking Rules and regulations. Student Parking Permit Fees: Online Parking Permit Purchase Information Now you can order your parking permit conveniently online 24/7! After registering for classes in your portal, go to #31 on your Student Tab. That will take you to the webpage of our permit vendor, Credentials Order Processing Services, to complete your order. Enter your mailing address, license plate and registration information for each vehicle you drive. Credentials will process your permit and mail it to you approximately within a week. You can print a temporary permit to display in the meantime. There is no cost for students to purchase permits online. It is easier, faster, and strongly encouraged. DISPLAY OF PERMIT Student and staff parking permits must be clearly displayed. The student parking permit decal must be affixed to the driver’s side windshield, at the lower left hand corner. The staff parking permit hanger must be displayed from the rear view mirror, or a window sticker affixed to the left side of the rear window, or a bumper sticker affixed to the left side of the rear bumper. Day use parking permits must be placed face up on the vehicle’s driver’s side dash board. Failure to display a valid parking permit will result in the issuance of a parking citation. (AP6750) It is the policy of the College to dismiss parking citations for students who have purchased a parking permit and who have been issued a parking citation for “No Valid Permit Displayed” or “Improper Display of Permit” in a student parking lot, if dismissal is requested within 35 calendar days of citation issuance and a $5 processing fee has been paid to cover the cost of processing these dismissals. Only one parking citation per semester will be dismissed for these reasons. PERMIT REFUNDS A refund of the fee will be made through the end of the second week of the fall and spring semesters, and the first week of the winter and summer intersessions. The permit must be returned with the application for refund. If it has already been affixed to the window/bumper, it must be removed and the pieces returned. 1100 N.

You can also make requests online at https://helpdesk.mtsac.edu/, check the status of your requests, and correspond with an IT Help Desk technician about your request. Zoom: All Mt. SAC faculty and staff are able to get a license for Zoom. To access your TechConnectZoom account from within Canvas, it is important that you sign in from the Mt. SAC TechConnectZoom login page at https://mtsac-edu.zoom.us/. A shortcut is on the Faculty tab of the Portal. If you sign up at the corporate Zoom website, your Zoom profile page, will have the license type of “basic”. To upgrade a basic Zoom account using your Mt. SAC email, please contact IT Help Desk and submit a ticket by calling 909-274-4357 or online. OneDrive: We recommend using OneDrive for your documents and files. OneDrive is easy to use for collaborating with your coworkers. All employees have OneDrive enabled in the cloud, and the OneDrive app is installed and enabled on all Windows computers (simply search the Windows start menu for “OneDrive” and login using your portal login in an email format like jmountie5@mtsac.edu). As we transition to remote work, several requests have come in for staff to take existing desktop computers home. This can be a good option since mobile equipment resources are limited. To obtain authorization to do this, as a manager, send a list of employees you want to have take equipment home, and what equipment you’re authorizing to leave campus, to Dvickers@mtsac.edu. Please do not let anyone take equipment off campus until the IT staff has approved it. Campus systems are not designed to be administered remotely, and we need to install the ability for IT to do so before the systems leave the campus network. Complete a Computer Loaner Agreement form for each computer/desktop on your list that was approved by Dale. Collect and maintain the forms from your employees. If you (staff) want to make a request, send a message to your manager, and copy dvickers@mtsac.edu. Once your manager approves the request, IT will move as quickly as possible to do the required work to prepare the system. Please do not take equipment off campus until the IT staff has approved it. Campus systems are not designed to be administered remotely, and we need to install the ability for IT to do so before the systems leave the campus network.

Our Commitment Colleagues, High ethics and integrity are very important to Mt. San Antonio College. We want to do everything possible to maintain a positive image in our community. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants states that one of the most important steps in protecting any organization from fraud is to provide a mechanism for reporting fraud and unethical practices. In fact, public companies are required by law to provide a reporting mechanism. Fraud hotlines have proven to be a powerful and cost-effective loss prevention tool for organizations using them. Therefore, we have established an anonymous reporting mechanism for you to report suspected fraud. We have subscribed to ethicspoint which is operated by an outside agency, not by internal staff. This service provides a toll-free telephone number (1-866-367-7970), and a web site https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/54937/index.html, for you to submit anonymous alerts to well-trained Certified Fraud Examiners. We strongly urge you to support this program. We all play an important role in protecting the assets of our College. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimates that organizations can lose up to 6% of annual revenues due to fraud. If you suspect inappropriate use of College funds or resources, please report them immediately. Don’t hesitate to report a suspected activity even if you believe the dollar amount to be small. Thank you for doing your part to protect the integrity of Mt. San Antonio College. We take pride in making Mt. San Antonio College a highly ethical, professional, and fraud-free organization. See the Mt. SAC Anonymous Ethics Hotline FAQs for more information.

impact As a donor, nothing is better than seeing your contributions in action. We are excited to share these examples of recent support, and how your help impacts our work every day. $165,000 to the Mt. SAC Agriculture Program Last Spring, The Orange County Farm Bureau (OCFB) donated $165,000 to the Mt. SAC Agriculture Program, enabling the college to provide scholarships for agriculture students and build an endowment for the Agriculture Department's student ambassadors program. Students who serve as ambassadors gain valuable experience working as part of a team and interacting with the public and college leadership. Agriculture Ambassadors also visit area high schools to share information about Mt. SAC's wide range of offerings with students who have a passion for agriculture. The OCFB's program endowment is the very first of its kind at Mt. SAC. Reach for the Stars This program is funded by a $5,000 annual gift from Edison International and community members and brings area students to the Randall Planetarium and Observatory. The funding makes the experience free for these third and fifth graders from low-income school districts. In August 2017, the Mt. SAC Foundation and Alumni Association collaborated with the college's solar eclipse viewing party by distributing glasses and collecting a $1 suggested donation. More than $2,800 was raised and just that amount will enable five classes to participate in Reach for the Stars. Funds for dreamers The Mt. SAC family rallied to support the college's undocumented students, following dramatic changes to the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2017. Nearly $15,000 was raised within weeks to help students known as "Dreamers" pay to renew DACA paperwork. Mt. SAC has approximately 3,000 Dreamers, and of those, more than 50 percent are eligible for DACA. $157,000 Raised at 30th annual Golf classic Thanks to the hard work of dozens of staff, students, volunteers, and sponsors, the tournament raised more than $157,000! Proceeds help fund the Mt. SAC Athletics program and provide essential operational resources for the Foundation and Alumni Association. We also honored the life and family of a member of Mt. SAC's first graduating class. Irven "Pete" Reynolds was one of the Foundation and Alumni Association's greatest benefactors. Together, we all reach new heights.

News We’re always proud of the way the Mountie community supports Mt. SAC students in need, and this has never been more true than during the COVID-19 crisis. When the pandemic hit, the College and its community partners came together to make sure that our students are getting what they need, starting with enough to eat. When Jamie and Bryan Robinson lost their son in an accident six weeks after his high school graduation in 1999, they knew they couldn’t let Josh’s dreams die with him. That’s why they established the Joshua Michael Robinson Memorial Scholarship for fire and paramedic students at Mt. SAC. Since April 2006, the scholarship has been supporting a fire student and a paramedic student in alternating years. At Mt. SAC, the alumni net is wide. Whether you got a certificate, attended a training, earned a degree, or took a single class, you’re alumni. The richness of that pool is what makes Mt. SAC exceptional. Are you a “Mountie Among Us”? Wesley is currently employed at Microsoft, and he is eager to take advantage of the company’s philanthropic matching program. He feels fortunate to work for an organization that prioritizes giving of time and money. Volunteering is built into the culture, and Wesley has been tutoring low income children in the Seattle area. His gift to the WIN is a two-to-one match, and it will help the WIN change the lives of many people just like Wesley. At the Thanksgiving meal drive-thru, each student received a prepared meal for four people (turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cornbread, and apple pie), a bag of groceries, and a bottle of Martinelli’s cider. This week the California Community College system was the recipient of the largest gift ever to community colleges in the United States. The relationship between Mt. SAC and Unical Aviation has been going strong for several years, and it represents a new incarnation of philanthropy. The College's experience with corporate philanthropy has typically been more of a one way street. A business would donate to the non-profit, and that was that. Of course, the business benefited from a spirit of goodwill and perhaps a tax incentive, but the results were not always more tangible than that. What Mt. SAC and Unical are doing is creating a substantial benefit for both sides of the equation. Dominique Tan, Unical’s Chief Social Innovation Officer, refers to the company as a “relationship-based organization” and explains that “Unical is excited to continue responding to evolving needs of the students, workforce, and broader community.” The public utility company Southern California Edison (SCE) has long been a supporter of Mt. SAC’s STEM students, and recently the company has expanded its support to include the College’s Fire Program. “We need qualified and well-trained fire service professionals, and dedicated students should not have to turn down acceptance into a Fire Academy because they cannot afford the training materials and equipment,” explains Lisa Woon, SCE principal manager for Corporate Philanthropy. Luckily for college students in California, awareness of the fullness of the college affordability issue is spreading to the state legislature. There are two bills under consideration that would affect Mt. SAC’s students. On Sept. 12, we, the Mt. San Antonio College Foundation and Alumni Association, announced a $3 million gift from the estate of Diana Berger. This is the largest gift in the history of the College. Together, we all reach new heights. BOARD RESOURCESEVENTSCOMMUNITY CONNECTIONSCONTACT US Stay Connected! Sign up to receive news and updates.

We’re proud of these connections, and we’ve highlighted some of them here. Featured Campus Programs The Foundation and Alumni Association tends to think everyone at Mt. SAC is a star, but sometimes it's nice to see real stars. The Randall Planetarium is one of the campus's most popular (and most impressive) features. We're proud to host events there and support its programs. We know a college is only as good as its library so we support ours in any way we can! It's so much more than books but books are an important part. Mt. SAC has a vibrant theatre scene, and the Foundation and Alumni Association supports plays, recitals, and performances of all kinds. Nothing beats the energy of being there in person! The Foundation and Alumni Association sells tickets out of the campus box office. Mountie Athletics is the pride of campus, and the Foundation and Alumni Association loves to support the campus athletes. The Mt. SAC art gallery is one of the jewels in the campus's crown, and the Foundation and Alumni Association is proud to support its exhibitions and programs, including EXAMPLE. We believe Mt. SAC speaks for itself, and we encourage our current and future donors to visit us for a tour. You'll get to witness firsthand the impact of your contributions. Together, we all reach new heights.

Mountie Spotlight Recent Alumni of the Year We're proud of all of our alums, and we pick a new one to highlight every year. Nominate someone today! 2019 Alumnus of the Year 2018 Alumna of the Year 2017 Alumnus of the Year 2016 Alumnus of the Year 2015 Alumnus of the Year 2015 Alumnus of the Year 2014 Alumnus of the Year 2013 Alumna of the Year 2012 Alumnus of the Year 2011 Alumnus of the Year 2010 Alumnus of the Year 2009 Alumnus of the Year Alumni Stories Our alums are really special. They're all over the world, doing good work across many fields, and we can't wait to tell you about them! From growing up in Chino Hills to attending Mt. SAC to starting their wildly successful court reporting business, identical twin sisters Whitney Kumar and Kamryn Villegas are typical Mountie alumnae, which of course means they are anything but typical. Erica has been supervising the WIN for twenty years now, and she can’t imagine doing anything else with her life. Bryce and Jerrica (née Morales) Gordon both grew up in the Mt. SAC area and were drawn to the school because of its aviation program. Bryce wanted to be a pilot, and Jerrica was a budding aviation fan. Neither could have guessed how much the College would impact both their personal and professional lives. I work as a software engineer at Microsoft in Seattle. When it came time for dancer Dove Dellos-Kilde to choose a college back in 1996, she intended to earn a business degree while pursuing her true passion—dance—on the side. She had no idea that at Mt. SAC, she’d find a dance family she’d carry with her for the rest of her life. During the stay home circumstances dictated by the COVID-19 public health crisis, artists of all kinds are finding innovative ways to continue their crafts and share their talents with the world. Mt. SAC alumna Lia Booth is no different. I provide HR support to Aircraft Maintenance throughout the Western United States. Prior to attending the program at Mt. SAC I was in a career field that I had no passion for, which can take a toll on a person. Attending this program put me on the path of turning a lifelong love of commercial aviation into a career. Chief Bertelsen is also a strong supporter of community outreach efforts by law enforcement. He believes it is absolutely necessary for the Azusa Police Department to have strong partnerships with the community. That two African-American sisters from Diamond Bar, California would both end up working as TV writers on shows we’ve actually heard of like Criminal Minds and How to Get Away With Murder is unlikely, but it happened for Kim and Erika Harrison. Of course, their story started at Mt. SAC. Together, we all reach new heights. BOARD RESOURCESEVENTSCOMMUNITY CONNECTIONSCONTACT US Stay Connected! Sign up to receive news and updates.

Alumni Stories: Whitney Kumar and Kamryn Villegas From growing up in Chino Hills to attending Mt. SAC to starting their wildly successful court reporting business, identical twin sisters Whitney Kumar and Kamryn Villegas are typical Mountie alumnae, which of course means they are anything but typical. Did Kamryn and Whitney make the decision to attend Mt. SAC together? It depends on which one you ask. One thing is for sure, though: being Mounties was inevitable. Both women played high school sports and were lured by Mt. SAC’s top-tier athletics program. Since they had grown up so close to Mt. SAC, Whitney and Kamryn always knew the College had a great reputation, and that it would be a logical next step for them after high school. Both women focused on general education classes at Mt. SAC since neither knew what career path they wanted to pursue. Mt. SAC turned out to be an ideal place to explore their different options. Whitney was recruited by the women’s golf coach, and she finally got the opportunity to play on a women’s team after having to play on the boys team in high school. Kamyrn ran track and cross country for Mt. SAC. Both women found lifelong friends and made countless happy memories while at Mt. SAC. While at Mt. SAC, Whitney took a computer class and fell in love with the process of typing. She declared that she wanted to find a job where she could work on a computer all day, preferably typing. A classmate joked that she should become a court reporter, but Whitney took the suggestion seriously. She did some research about the job and then asked her uncle, a district attorney in Los Angeles, for advice. With her uncle’s encouragement, she enrolled in court reporting school at South Coast College and found her passion. She soon convinced her sister to join her there. Court reporting school is a tough path, and the dropout rate is high. Kamryn and Whitney were adequately prepared for the rigors of court reporting school because of their experiences as athletes: practice is the key to succeeding in court reporting school, just like in sports. The process of learning to be a court reporter is like learning a new language. Court reporters type phonetically and learn to listen for sounds rather than words. It usually takes a student three to five years to complete court reporting school. (It only took Whitney two.) In order to be a court reporter in the state of California, an individual must pass a test and be able to type 200 words per minute with 98 percent accuracy. Court reporters are in high demand, and the sisters had their pick of jobs. Kamryn worked freelance on depositions while Whitney went to work for a family court judge in LA County. She was the court reporter for high profile cases like Britney Spears trying to get custody of her children. After several years, budget cuts forced the County to lay off all the civil court reporters, and Whitney found herself doing freelance work like Kamryn. Starting their own firm seemed like the best next move for their careers. Their freelance history meant that they had a handful of lawyers who would become their client base, and they began searching for more. Luckily, they were scrappy and had great reputations within the law community. In the early days of KW Court Reporting, Whitney and Kamryn would meet their parents in a parking lot, hand over their children, and head inside an office building, armed with cookies their mom had made, to solicit new business. KW Court Reporting grew quickly, and now eight years later, they have eight employees and 200 freelance court reporters and work with over 300 law firms. The business is so successful that Kamryn and Whitney don’t usually perform regular court reporting duties anymore. That frees them up to work on new business, maintain client relationships, and pursue fun projects. One such project is Judy Justice, a new Judge Judy reality show featuring Whitney as the court reporter. Both Whitney and Kamryn are grateful to have attended Mt. SAC. The College’s atmosphere created a low-stress environment for them to determine the paths they’d take afterwards, and the quality education they received there facilitated a smooth transition to court reporting school. Kamryn recalls her time as a Mountie as “a very happy time in my life” that “shaped who I am.” Whitney is relieved she didn’t choose a four-year university where she would have been stuck with a career path before she was really ready to pick one. “I’m doing something I want to do rather than something I was forced to do,” she says. Once again, Mt. SAC has paved a golden path for its alumni. Alumni Stories: Erica Ledezma Together, we all reach new heights. BOARD RESOURCESEVENTSCOMMUNITY CONNECTIONSCONTACT US Stay Connected!

Alumni Stories: Erica Ledezma The story of how Erica Ledezma became a Mountie exemplifies the spirit, grit, and determination she uses to approach all things in life, and it demonstrates the College’s biggest asset: its ability to bring out the best in everyone who enrolls. Erica grew up playing soccer, a sport she learned at the Boys and Girls Club she frequented after school while her single mom was working two jobs to make sure Erica and her siblings had everything they needed. Some of her friends were going to college after high school—some even to Mt. SAC—and although Erica had been a good student and a great soccer player, she didn’t have college on her radar. She knew she was expected to get a job and start making money for her family. The idea of Mt. SAC scratched at the back of her mind, though, and one day during that summer after high school, she decided to drive over to the campus to see what Mt. SAC was all about. She found her way to the soccer field and eventually to the women’s soccer coach, Debbie Cavion. Erica asked if she could be on the soccer team, and Debbie told her that try-outs had already happened. In fact, the team was already a week into practice. Erica wouldn’t take no for an answer, and she convinced the coach to let her try out anyway. She impressed Debbie so much that she earned a spot on the team. That team, with Erica as a forward, ended up winning the state championship the very next year. Mt. SAC was special for Erica in the classroom, on the soccer field, and everywhere in between. She transferred to Cal Poly to get her bachelor’s degree, but Mt. SAC was never far from her mind. Her experience there shaped the course of her entire life. She learned how education functions not just as knowledge acquisition but as a door opener to a myriad of opportunities. Soccer also opened doors for Erica. The team was a family, and she had never played—before or since—with teammates of that quality, not even when she played professionally. While a student at Cal Poly, Erica coached a junior varsity girls soccer team at a local private high school. There, she met the mother of one of her players who was the director of Community Education at Mt. SAC at the time. She asked Erica what she was planning to do after she graduated. Erica’s immediate plans were to have a baby, and after her son was born, Erica headed back to Mt. SAC, this time as a staff member. After working with students who had been at-risk and were now getting their GEDs, a population Erica found she was very passionate about supporting, she became part of the team starting a tutoring and support center for student athletes at Mt. SAC. Called the WIN, this program was the first of its kind for community colleges. Programs like it existed at Division I and Division II institutions, and Mt. SAC wanted to support its athletes in the same way, so that they could become Division I student athletes. Although the WIN was originally conceived for student athletes, it eventually expanded to be open to all students. That means Erica never has to turn away a student. Erica has been supervising the WIN for twenty years now, and she can’t imagine doing anything else with her life. That higher education was something she initially thought was out of her reach but has become her life’s work is nothing short of a blessing. Supporting the Mt. SAC student population, which is made up largely of first generation college students just like she was, is what Erica was meant to do.

Alumni Stories: Jerrica and Bryce Gordon Bryce and Jerrica Gordon Bryce and Jerrica (née Morales) Gordon both grew up in the Mt. SAC area and were drawn to the school because of its aviation program. Bryce wanted to be a pilot, and Jerrica was a budding aviation fan. Neither could have guessed how much the College would impact both their personal and professional lives. The pair met in 2006 when Bryce was training to be a pilot, and Jerrica had just begun a four-year degree at the University of La Verne across the street from Brackett Field, where Mt. SAC’s flight school is. Even though Jerrica wasn’t a flight student, the program encouraged her enthusiasm, and she became a lifelong aviation supporter. That inclusivity is how the program operates. It embraces anyone who is interested, regardless of their experience level or their career aspirations. David Todd, coordinator of the Mt. SAC flight program, knew Jerrica was interested in any opportunity that would get her closer to the aircraft so he suggested she ask Bryce to show her how to wash the planes. Like many of the programs at Mt. SAC, the flight school is hands-on from day one. As a student, Bryce worked on the planes and one of his duties was washing the airplanes. Being new to Mt. SAC, Jerrica didn’t know that the flight school was operated by students and expected the person she was looking for to be an instructor or at least a professional of some kind. But Bryce was a student, just like her. They hit it off, and Bryce likely sealed their fate when he offered to take Jerrica on her first flight in a small aircraft. They’ve been taking flights together ever since. They competed together on the Mt. SAC flying team and made lifelong friends in the program. Bryce eventually worked as a flight instructor at Mt. SAC and earned a four year degree through Mt. SAC’s partnership with Southern Illinois University. His job took them to Colorado and then to Florida, where he is currently a captain for Frontier Airlines. Jerrica’s career advanced alongside Bryce’s. She earned a master’s degree while in Denver and now works as a Senior Benefit Technology Consultant for Lincoln Financial. They live on the Atlantic Ocean and can see space launches from their home so they’re looking up at the sky even when they aren’t flying. The Gordons’ first dance at the Mt. SAC hangar The Mt. SAC flight program formed the foundation for the Gordons’ relationship and their approach to life. The values of education, dedication, and team work that they learned at Mt. SAC are still with them. In fact, they love Mt. SAC so much that they even had their wedding reception in August 2010 at the Mt. SAC hangar at Brackett Field. For their ten-year wedding anniversary, they knew the only way to celebrate was to give back to the community that has given them so much. Pilot training isn’t like other collegiate coursework. Students pay by the hour to practice in order to meet the steps necessary to get a license. Of course, Mt. SAC keeps the cost to students low, and Bryce is grateful for how affordable his unparalleled education was. But the Gordons don’t want cost to be a barrier to anyone who dreams of flying. That’s why they’re establishing a scholarship named after the runway, 26L (“two-six-left”), where they took their very first flight together.

Wesley graduated from UC San Diego in 2015 and now works as a software engineer at Microsoft in Seattle. He feels fortunate to work for a company which builds philanthropy into the culture up and down the food chain. They encourage giving of both time and money, and Wesley uses that encouragement to spend time tutoring low income students in Seattle. How did your Mt. SAC experience impact your journey? Wesley considers his time at Mt. SAC the two most pivotal years of his life. He was in the honors program and on the water polo team, but the most significant impact came from the WIN Program, which gave him the support he needed to believe in his own abilities and talents. There, he learned how to prioritize his time and apply the type of intensity he used for his sport to his academics as well. “Erica Ledezma and her program opened the doors for me to be where I am today.

Alumni Stories: Dove Dellos-Kilde Dove with her parents When it came time for dancer Dove Dellos-Kilde to choose a college back in 1996, she intended to earn a business degree while pursuing her true passion—dance—on the side. She had no idea that at Mt. SAC, she’d find a dance family she’d carry with her for the rest of her life. Dove has been a professional dancer (and a singer and actress) since she was three years old. Her mother is a professional dancer and it seemed natural for Dove to follow in her footsteps. As a child, she worked with Debbie Allen, Paula Abdul, and Sammy Davis, Jr. just to name a few. Even with all her professional experience, Dove was still impressed by the Mt. SAC dance program. Both the facilities and the teachers were operating at a professional level. The practice spaces were phenomenal and the performance theatre was Broadway caliber. The quality of the dance faculty matched the facilities. “The training we received can’t be compared to any other school,” Dove says. The teachers danced while they taught; that approach—dancing with their teachers—is invaluable to dance students. Lee Martino and Amy Bates Nakamura were two of Dove’s favorite teachers, and they are still in touch. They’ve even asked her to come to Mt. SAC to teach, and she in turn has invited them to do master classes at the dance studio she runs with her mother. Dove and her friends back in their Mt. SAC days Indeed, the dance community there has provided the foundation for both Dove’s professional life and her social life. “Dance friends are the best kind of friends,” she says. The friendships that grew from dancing at Mt. SAC are ones she sustains to this day. Their busy lives keep them from seeing each other regularly, but they’re on the phone with each other often. Dove and her friends make it a point to return to Mt. SAC to see performances each year, even though it has been over twenty years since they were students there. The program has continued to flourish, and in 2020, Mt. SAC will be offering an associate of arts degree in dance for the first time. Dove is beyond excited about this development, a rarity among colleges at any level. Of course, she wishes the AA degree had existed when she was a student, but she is thrilled for current and future students and Mt. SAC as a whole. “This degree will make them an industry leader,” she says. From her very first class, Dove was impressed by the welcoming attitude at Mt. SAC. With the remarkable facilities and the talent of teachers, the dance program easily could have been exclusionary, but instead it met students where they were. Students of all dance levels were integrated into all the courses, and everyone got a chance to perform. Being on stage at Mt. SAC helped solidify for Dove that performing was what she was meant to do with her life—and performing isn’t just for dancing. Dove was also a cheerleader at Mt. SAC, and she and some other Mountie alumni spent time on the cheer squad for the Polliwogs, a professional roller hockey team in Anaheim. When Broadway came calling (literally), Dove was just a few months shy of earning her business degree and wrapping up her time at Mt. SAC. It was a hard decision, but she chose to follow her dreams to New York City, where she starred in the stage version of Saturday Night Fever for a year. After that, her career took her around the world. She joined a cruise company as a dancer-singer. She was thrilled to get paid to do what she loves and travel and see the world in the process. When she finally returned to Southern California, Dove got married, had kids, and started running the dance studio her family has owned for over forty years, but she didn’t settle down. These days, her plate is full as the dance studio has three locations, she has three sons and a husband, and she has a thriving side gig as a personal trainer. She didn’t leave Mt. SAC behind, though. The culture of encouragement that the dance program fostered is one she tries to replicate in her teaching now. “The teachers wanted to see stars in our eyes,” she says, and she wants her students to dream, too. She is always telling them not to give up and has adopted “reach for the stars” as her personal motto. Although Dove didn’t start dancing at Mt. SAC, she found her calling there: as a performer, a teacher, and a friend. Do you want to support the Mt. SAC dance program?

As an aviation maintenance manager I oversee the repair and overhaul of major aircraft components which are sold to airline customers throughout the world. I assist in developing forecasting and production schedules for three maintenance crews and the paint department. I also play an integral role in the development and deployment of our training program designed to help transition mechanics who are early in their career into well rounded knowledgeable members of our team. How did your Mt. SAC experience impact your journey? I graduated from Mt. SAC’s Aircraft Maintenance Technology night program in June of 2013. Shortly after that I obtained my Airframe and Powerplant certificates from the FAA. Prior to attending the program at Mt. SAC I was in a career field that I had no passion for, which can take a toll on a person. Attending this program put me on the path of turning a lifelong love of commercial aviation into a career. I can now have the honor of working as part of a dedicated team of aviation professionals who strive to do the best work they can every day. The aviation maintenance field can be challenging and stressful at times, deadlines are tight and safety is key; the airlines need to keep their aircraft safely flying. Each day I embrace that challenge because I am proud of the work we do and proud of the team I work with. Mt. SAC gave me the key to starting this career.

Alumni Stories: Harrison Sisters That two African-American sisters from Diamond Bar, California would both end up working as TV writers on shows we’ve actually heard of like Criminal Minds and How to Get Away With Murder is unlikely, but it happened for Kim and Erika Harrison. Of course, their story started at Mt. SAC. Mt. SAC was a natural next step after high school for both women. Growing up in a family full of teachers, college wasn’t optional. Neither knew what they wanted to study, though, so they headed down the road to Walnut, California to attend Mt. SAC. The College was convenient and inexpensive without sacrificing quality: they knew they would get hands on learning opportunities that would give them a chance to discover their passions. Kim’s passion started to spark during an interpersonal communication class with Phillip Maynard. From there, she was star-struck when she ended up in a class taught by Tammy Trujillo, whom she had grown up listening to on the radio. Tammy wanted Kim to work at KWFB in Hollywood, but Kim says she “didn’t know there was life outside Pasadena” and was nervous. Eventually, she made that leap and several others that led to a career in TV writing. Erika was also inspired by Tammy Trujillo and expected to have a career in radio, and then Dan Smith’s TV and film class opened up a new possibility for her. The classes at Mt. SAC focused on firsthand experience, and she learned all aspects of the production process, which included making short films which she wrote, directed, and produced herself. These short films showed her that writing was her favorite part of the process. Looking back, Kim says it makes sense that she and Erika became TV writers because they were obsessed with TV, especially soap operas, when they were growing up. Kim hated going to school because it kept her from watching her soaps. Erika also really liked The Wonder Years and is still discovering the impact that show had on her. Both were attracted to TV because of the storytelling aspect. Erika likes strong female leads who are complicated and imperfect and a sense of family, whatever that may entail. Sometimes it is the traditional concept of family, but sometimes it means chosen family or a work team that functions like a family. Kim is drawn to procedurals and enjoys finding opportunities to play with that structure. While both women were finding steady work in the TV industry following their time at Mt. SAC, each went on to earn her BA. Kim did it for their grandmother. Seeing Kim’s name in the credits for Criminal Minds every week wasn’t enough; she wanted Kim to have the security of a bachelor’s degree. Family is important to the Harrisons; they still have family dinners every Sunday in Diamond Bar. Their vibe isn’t competitive; they make each other better. They help each other work through issues from writing blocks to career moves. They have worked together at various points in their careers, but the dream of course is to run a show together. For now, both sisters have new jobs for the 2019-2020 TV season. Deputy on FOX premieres after the Super Bowl, and it will be Kim’s first turn at being a showrunner, which means she’s responsible for all the moving parts of putting each episode together. Erika will be a supervising producer (which is a writing job, despite how it sounds) on Nancy Drew, CW’s retelling of the old book series. What seemed so impossible when they were growing up in Diamond Bar twenty years ago feels more realistic these days, as the Harrison sisters are hardly the only black women writing television shows. Their cooperative spirit isn’t limited to each other; they are part of a network of black female TV writers called Black Women Who Brunch (BWB). The organization, which now has more than 60 members, began in 2014 when Nkechi Okoro Carroll (then an executive story editor on Bones), Lena Waithe (then a new staff writer on Bones), and Erika L. Johnson (then a writer on Being Mary Jane) went looking for a tangible way to encourage other black women in the industry. BWB seems like a good fit for Erika and Kim Harrison, since supporting each other has always been at the forefront of their relationship. Are you feeling inspired to make sure others have the same opportunities the Harrison sisters had at Mt. SAC?

Augie Max Vargas In many ways, Emmy-award winner (and four time Emmy nominee) Augie Max Vargas’ story mirrors that of many Mt. SAC students. The son of Filipino immigrants, he was born in the United States but spent some time in the Philippines until his family settled in Southern California. Augie spent his early adolescence in Burbank surrounded by the TV industry. The Wonder Years sometimes shot scenes at his school, and he could spot The A-Team’s crew down the street. Warner Bros. and NBC had their studios in Burbank. Evidence of TV and movie making was everywhere. Augie calls Burbank “the media capital of the world.” He fell into a role behind the scenes early. When his school put on a talent show, he was the stage manager. At home, he took up the video camera and filmed family gatherings, and he and his older brother made fan films for superheroes like Batman and Daredevil. If you’re hoping for a clip, Augie has bad news: “Sadly none of that footage still exists.” Although his family moved to Pomona before he started high school, his formative years in Burbank stayed with him, and television production was always in the back of his mind. It took him awhile to consider it as a career, though. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to study after high school, but Augie chose higher education anyway. He was drawn to Mt. SAC because of its proximity and affordability, qualities that attract many of its students. After a bumpy start, including a brief stint crawling through the ceilings of office buildings in order to network cable, Augie fell into a groove with video production courses at Mt. SAC. Like so many other Mt. SAC students, he discovered on this campus a foundation for the rest of his life. He was able to dive right into video production work both in the studio and with the video truck on live news and sports productions. The classes exposed him to all aspects of video production like voiceover work, editing, camera work, running audio cables, and mixing audio. Prof. Jillian Bennett Sterkin was instantly one of his favorite teachers. Her humor made her classroom a welcoming environment ripe for learning. She soon recognized Augie’s potential (and personality) and encouraged him to take a turn as a host on the College’s radio station. Prof. Sterkin then connected him with her husband David Doyle who is a producer. That introduction led to an internship which led to a career spanning nineteen years and counting. Legend comes up often when Augie describes some of the people he has gotten a chance to work with. The list includes Dick Clark, Don Mischer, and Ken Ehrlich (all who have stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame) as well as Louis J. Horvitz (who is a multi-Emmy winning director). Augie has also worked on television projects like the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, PBS’s In Performance at the White House: Memphis Soul, where he got to shake hands with President Obama, and even nine Super Bowl halftime shows. A prominent theme in Augie’s career is awards shows. He has worked on every major televised awards show: the Grammys, the Oscars, the Emmys, the Kids’ Choice Awards, you name it. He also produces The Sci-Tech Awards where he gets to work alongside names like Sir Patrick Stewart, Margot Robbie, David Oyelowo, and John Cho. The highlight (so far) of this illustrious career came in 2017, when Augie won an Emmy for The Oscars: All Access. He served as producer on that show, but he calls the production “a team effort.” Augie officially started his impressive career on the production team for the 2000 Academy Awards ceremony, but of course the arc of his story started here at Mt. SAC. Looking ahead, Augie would like to give back to men and women wanting to get into the production industry. He sees this designation as a step in that direction. To that end, in April 2019, he visited campus to work with about 20 current Mt. SAC students to put together his honoree video. That quickly turned into a Q&A session in which Augie enthusiastically imparted advice and experience. He then invited Mt. SAC grad Anthony Flores to watch him work at the Kids Choice Awards. Augie didn’t stop there. He also got Anthony an internship at the Teen Choice Awards, which resulted in Anthony’s very first credit. Being Alumnus of the Year is not something Augie takes lightly. “This honor means the world to me,” he says. When he left Mt. SAC, he took with him a certificate in Television Production, invaluable experience, and a lifelong fondness for his alma mater. Elizabeth Yang Together, we all reach new heights.

Elizabeth Yang Elizabeth Yang lives by the motto: If there’s an opportunity, take it. So when her mom encouraged her to attend Mt. SAC while still a Walnut High School student, she agreed. Elizabeth was already familiar with the college because her family lived within walking distance of the campus. “My mom actually picked our residence because of Mt. SAC,” she said. Elizabeth was a shy and introverted 15-year-old and the thought of taking classes as a dual enrollment student at Mt. SAC was intimidating. But that all changed once classes got underway. “When I was sitting in class, I was the youngest, but all the students made me feel welcome,” she recalled. “They became older brothers and sisters.” She found herself inspired and grateful to have the opportunity to be amongst college students, working professionals, and people of all backgrounds. “We learned from each other,” Elizabeth said. “It provided a widening of my education, experience and knowledge that I would not have been able to obtain any other way.” After Mt. SAC, Elizabeth went on to UC Berkeley where she graduated in 2 1/2 years with a double major in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “The ratio of women to men was 1:12 and I was often the only women in class.” She would return to take courses at Mt. SAC during the summer and winter breaks from Berkeley. After graduation, Elizabeth worked for Raytheon Company as an electrical engineer designing radar systems for the B2 Bomber. She has also interned at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab, working as a team member on the main control unit of the Mars Exploration Rover. Elizabeth later switched gears and obtained her law degree from the University of La Verne. She began practicing law in 2007 and in 2011 founded her own practice: the Law and Mediation Office of Elizabeth Yang. She specializes in intellectual property law, business law and family law. In both 2016 and 2017, Elizabeth was awarded “Top 100 Civil Lawyers” and “Top 40 Lawyers Under 40” by the National Trial Lawyers Association. In 2017, Elizabeth was also awarded the “Lawyers of Distinction” award, representing the top 10% of lawyers around the nation. Elizabeth is a member of the Mt. SAC Foundation Board and lives in Monterey Park with her husband Phil and her two children, Liliana and Alexander. We are proud to honor Elizabeth Yang as our 2018 Alumna of the Year.

Willie Lee Daniels As a commercial pilot for United Airlines, it’s easy for Capt. Willie Lee Daniels to see the 30,000-foot view, and not just out his front window. With pilot retirements climbing every year and fewer and fewer young people joining the industry, Capt. Daniels in 1999 founded the non-profit educational organization Shades of Blue. Shades of Blue provides academic support to students interested in the science, technology, engineering and math fields and helps to foster their careers in aviation, aerospace and engineering. Through his group’s efforts, Capt. Daniels is aiming to feed 250,000 new pilots, engineers and astronauts into the industry pipeline. “My goal is for young people to see astronauts and others who have had amazing careers -- and amazing lives -- because of their success in aerospace and aviation,” Capt. Daniels says. “If young people see that type of success, hopefully they will want to choose a similar career path.” A former Pomona resident and Ganesha High School graduate (’73), Capt. Daniels earned his associate’s degree in commercial piloting from Mt. San Antonio College in 1976 and his bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and Management from Metropolitan State University of Denver in 1978. Capt. Daniels was honored by the City of Pomona in 2006 with the Community Service Award, and by United Airlines in 2012 with the Volunteer Impact Grant Award. In 2013, he received the Pearl of Africa Award for Aviation Science, Education, and Leadership at the 2013 International Education, Business, Technology, and Investment Conference. Capt. Daniels lives in Castle Pines, Colo. with his wife, Perezza, and two daughters, Danielle and Dana. We are proud to honor Capt. Willie Lee Daniels as our 2017 Alumnus of the Year.

Tobie Hatfield Tobie Hatfield was one of the top three pole vaulters in the country while he was a Mountie. Now, as the Athlete Innovation Director with the Nike Corporation, Hatfield continues to vault to the top as an icon in the athletic show industry, working directly with famous athletes to help create numerous designs and innovations. As a high school athlete, Hatfield captured the Oregon State Pole Vault Championship. He later moved to Taiwan where his father coached the Taiwanese Track and Field Team to prepare for the 1980 Olympics. Hatfield resumed his pole vaulting career at Mt. SAC. He captured the Mt. SAC Relays Community College title in 1983, becoming the Mounties' No. 1 vaulter and one of the top three pole vaulters in the nation. He later transferred to Abilene Christian University, where he earned All-Academic All-American honors. Hatfield joined Nike in 1990 and worked in the corporation's research and development center in Taiwan for five years and was promoted to senior engineer of advanced projects. The renowned designer developed some of Nike's signature models including the Michael Johnson Olympic "Gold Shoe," the ACG Trail Running Line, the Nike Free, and PV Lite. He helped launch Nike's celebrated Innovation Kitchen in 2000. Today, Hatfield works closely on product design with many sports superstars, including Maria Sharapova and Tiger Woods. But, perhaps even more exciting than that is Hatfield's involvement in driving a number of the company's significant advances in sneaker and apparel technology. He most recently developed a cutting-edge wrap-around zipper system in sneakers for physically challenged athletes. "We do such a great job helping athletes perform better, run faster, jump higher, and all that kind of stuff," says Hatfield. "But what about performing better just in the sense of quality of life? When we say, 'if you have a body, you're an athlete,' that means everybody." Outside of work, Hatfield spends much of his time with his wife and volunteers coaching track and field in his home state of Oregon. He has two sons and a daughter.

Hector Javier Preciado Hector Javier Preciado embodies what Mt. SAC endeavors to do for our students. An immigrant from Mexico who was raised in the projects in Boyle Heights (East LA), he enrolled at Mt. SAC back in 1997, returning to school after an 18 month hiatus. He’s always been a person of great intellectual capacity but as a first generation college student he lacked the insights about succeeding in college. He is the 11th of 13 children and was the first in his family to attend college, initially enrolling at UC Santa Cruz right out of high school. After leaving for academic reasons, he returned to school at Mt. SAC with a zeal to get back on track. At first, he had some troubles re-entering college, but by the time he graduated he became a member of our Honors program, amassed a 3.5 GPA, and transferred to the highly prestigious Pomona College, in Claremont. At Pomona, he continued to hone his skills as a leader and earned Bachelor’s degree in Sociology with a Minor in Media Studies. After graduating from Pomona, he went to work in Public Policy at the Berkeley based Greenlining Institute as a Summer Associate and eventually became its first Chief Operating Officer. While there, he became a regular Political Analyst for Univision and Telemundo, the country’s two largest Spanish TV networks, commenting on state and National policy issues and elections. During his last three years at Greenlining, he completed his MBA from the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley. While there, he was elected Student Body President of the part time program (the first Latino to hold that post) and was voted by his classmates as the commencement speaker. (You can view his speech here.) After graduating from Haas, Hector made a career pivot and started working with a technology startup in the Search Engine Marketing space. Currently, Hector is a Content Marketing Strategist at LinkedIn, the leading social media platform for professionals. Hector is one of the founding board members of Urban Ed Academy a non-profit organization providing educational and leadership programming for grammar school students in underserved communities in San Francisco, CA. He is also on the Board of the National Center for Youth Law, an organization whom are legal advocates for children in the Foster Care System. Most recently Hector has become an Advisor at Manos Accelerator whose mission is to jump start technology startups founded by Latinos. Hector is married with two beautiful sons. As you can see, Hector is a wonderful example of success, he is a role model to many, the pride of his community, and a proud Mountie.

Kimberly Ann Harrison Born into a family of teachers, Kimberly Ann Harrison always appreciated education. From the age of 10, she was sure she would follow in her parents’ footsteps and become a teacher. So it was not at all surprising that Kim decided to major in education when she enrolled at Mt. SAC in 1999 after graduating from Diamond Bar High School as an honor student and star athlete. Although that was the career path Kimberly chose, she was also harboring a passion for storytelling, bolstered by a vivid imagination. Solely out of curiosity, she enrolled in Professor Tammy Trujillo’s “Intro to Broadcasting” course, which opened her mind to promising career opportunities that more closely aligned with her passion. Kimberly explored the field further and was soon convinced that this was her career calling. So she changed her major to broadcasting. Under Professor Trujillo’s wing and mentorship, Kimberly cut her teeth as a news production assistant at Los Angeles radio station KFWB. Pursuing her passion for storytelling in the visual medium, she landed a prime opportunity to transition to television as an intern on the hit sitcom, Friends. Kimberly’s successes there resulted in a promotion to executive assistant. After Friends, she worked as an executive assistant on the popular spin-off comedy, Joey. In 2005, Kimberly found herself on the path leading to the job of her dreams. A former colleague invited her to work on a then-new crime show, called Criminal Minds. After three seasons, Kimberly got the chance to write a freelance episode, which won great reviews. With the success of that episode, she was promoted to a full-time staff writer in 2010. Last year, her episode, “Hope,” received such high praise that it was submitted for an Emmy nomination for “Best Drama Writing.” Kimberly, 33, credits her Mt. SAC professors—Dan Smith, Tammy Trujillo and Phil Maynard—for preparing her to succeed in a fiercely competitive industry. “Without their time and guidance, I wouldn't be where I am today,” she says. “The opportunities and the hands-on experience that I received at Mt. SAC were priceless. It not only taught me so much, but gave me the confidence I needed, especially in a tough business like this.” In 2001, Kimberly transferred from Mt. SAC to California State University, Northridge and then to UCLA, where she graduated last month from its Writers Program. She and her partner, Katherine, live in Burbank with their two sons, Julian (3) and Cameron (18 months). During down time, Kimberly mentors aspiring writers and helps raise funds for the Department of Children and Family Services as well as LGBT events. Her younger sister, Erika, is also a Mt. SAC alumna and works in the same industry. For her accomplishments and the distinction she brings to the college, Mt. SAC proudly presents its “2013 Alumna of the Year Award” to Kimberly Ann Harrison. Hector Javier Preciado Harumi “Bacon” Sakatani Together, we all reach new heights.

Harumi “Bacon” Sakatani Believing that the lessons of the past will empower us to create a better tomorrow, Harumi “Bacon” Sakatani has dedicated his entire life to documenting and educating others about the lessons learned from the internment of 120,000 American citizens of Japanese ancestry over 60 years ago. To many students at Mt. SAC, Bacon is the elderly gentleman who comes to campus to speak about World War II and his experience as a young teen in the internment camp at Heart Mountain, Wyoming. Bacon’s story begins in 1929. He was born and reared in El Monte, where he attended a segregated grammar school for Mexican and Japanese pupils from first through fifth grades. After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, prompting World War II, all persons of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast were placed into internment camps. The year was 1942 and Bacon was 13 years old. He and his family were first placed at the Pomona Assembly Center at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds. Soon afterward, they were sent to a permanent camp in Wyoming, where his family of seven lived in a 20-by-20 room with one light bulb, a stove for heat, and army cots for beds. After leaving the camp in 1945, the family settled temporarily in Idaho and then put down roots in Pomona on a broken-down farm the following year. Bacon returned to school and graduated from Pomona High School in 1947. He then enrolled in the newly opened Mt. San Antonio College and marched two years later with the college’s third graduating class. Not long after, he was drafted and served in the Korean War as a combat engineer. Since that time, the 82-year-old West Covina resident and retired Southern California Edison computer programmer has coordinated and documented reunions of former internees and continued to collect and archive documents, photos and newspaper clippings to make certain that younger generations do not forget what happened to him and thousands of others over six decades ago. Bacon is known as “Mr. Heart Mountain,” and an entire room honors him at a museum there. In 1994, he tracked down two original barracks in the Shoshone Valley and, with help from other internees, had one of them displayed at the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. Sharing these past experiences with current Mt. SAC students has enriched their lives and their historical perspective. For his commitment in this regard as well as other personal and societal contributions, Mt. SAC proudly bestows its distinguished “2012 Alumnus of the Year Award” upon Harumi “Bacon” Sakatani.

Antonio Pierce "Only adversity tests strength." This quote embodies the character and values of Mt. SAC's 2011 Distinguished Alumnus of the Year, Antonio Pierce. As a star NFL linebacker, he was known to flatten opposing lineman who dared penetrate the scrimmage line, but his true strength is a product of his indomitable will. Having overcome the adversities of growing up in Compton, young Antonio didn't have many college options after graduating as a star athlete at Paramount High School. Perhaps it was the "Antonio" name affinity or Mt. SAC's renowned reputation for athletics, but somehow Antonio made his way to Mt. San Antonio College and joined the football team in 1996. He quickly distinguished himself as an outstanding linebacker and soon became team captain, leading the Mounties to their first national championship. "Antonio has great football instincts and intelligence," recalls Coach Evans Roderick. "He's like a coach on the field, possessing the keen ability to size up situations quickly and knowing what to do." Upon graduating in 1998, Antonio was recruited by the University of Arizona, where his athletic prowess flourished even more. In 2001, Antonio went undrafted, but proved himself with the Washington Redskins as a free agent. His physical prowess was noticed by the New York Giants with whom he signed a six-year contract in 2005. As the legendary No. 58, Antonio was able to reap the benefits of his tenacity while establishing himself as one of the premiere playmaking linebackers in the league. He recorded a career-high 160 tackles (109 solo) and had eight games with 10 or more tackles, which earned his trip to Hawaii as first alternate to the 2006 Pro Bowl. In 2008, Antonio's hard work and determination paid off as the Giants upset the undefeated Patriots to win Super Bowl XLII. The loving husband and father of four also shines off the field. Inspired by his own experiences growing up in Compton, it has become his personal mission to improve the quality of life for the youth in the Long Beach/Compton area. For the past five years, Antonio has sponsored a free football camp for underprivileged youth. In 2006, he became the spokesperson for Giants Academy—a program designed to help inner-city children succeed despite obstacles in their life. Antonio also participates in the "Read Across America" program, wherein he reads to children whose parents are undergoing treatment for chemical dependency at the Odyssey House in Harlem. In recognition of his many community contributions, Antonio was named United Way's "Man of the Year" in 2007 and was honored by the Catholic Diocese. After a successful career that spanned nearly a decade, Antonio announced his retirement from the NFL last year. But never one to rest, he joined a different type of team, as an NFL analyst on ESPN. His lovely wife, Jocelyn, is also a sports commentator for NFL Network and Fox Sports West, and will add a fifth child to the couple's blended family in August. Whether reporting from the sidelines or coaching/mentoring young athletes, Antonio is determined to give a higher sense of purpose and motivation to all. Thus, in the spirit of humanitarianism and professional excellence, Mt. SAC proudly bestows its "Alumnus of the Year Award" upon Antonio Pierce on the occasion of the college's 65th anniversary.

Join us! Join the alumni association Mountie Spotlight i IMPACT Inspiring Connections.Elevating success. What does the Mt. SAC Foundation and Alumni Association do? The Mt. SAC Foundation and Alumni Association elevates the Mountie experience by engaging the extended community, supporting scholarships and programs, and adding value wherever we can so that together, we all can reach new heights. Foundation & Alumni Association Events Check out upcoming events! Mountie SpotlighT Featured Alumni Stories From growing up in Chino Hills to attending Mt. SAC to starting their wildly successful court reporting business, identical twin sisters Whitney Kumar and Kamryn Villegas are typical Mountie alumnae, which of course means they are anything but typical. Erica has been supervising the WIN for twenty years now, and she can’t imagine doing anything else with her life. Bryce and Jerrica (née Morales) Gordon both grew up in the Mt. SAC area and were drawn to the school because of its aviation program. Bryce wanted to be a pilot, and Jerrica was a budding aviation fan. Neither could have guessed how much the College would impact both their personal and professional lives. I work as a software engineer at Microsoft in Seattle. When it came time for dancer Dove Dellos-Kilde to choose a college back in 1996, she intended to earn a business degree while pursuing her true passion—dance—on the side. She had no idea that at Mt. SAC, she’d find a dance family she’d carry with her for the rest of her life. During the stay home circumstances dictated by the COVID-19 public health crisis, artists of all kinds are finding innovative ways to continue their crafts and share their talents with the world. Mt. SAC alumna Lia Booth is no different. I provide HR support to Aircraft Maintenance throughout the Western United States. Prior to attending the program at Mt. SAC I was in a career field that I had no passion for, which can take a toll on a person. Attending this program put me on the path of turning a lifelong love of commercial aviation into a career. Chief Bertelsen is also a strong supporter of community outreach efforts by law enforcement. He believes it is absolutely necessary for the Azusa Police Department to have strong partnerships with the community. That two African-American sisters from Diamond Bar, California would both end up working as TV writers on shows we’ve actually heard of like Criminal Minds and How to Get Away With Murder is unlikely, but it happened for Kim and Erika Harrison. Of course, their story started at Mt. SAC.

Financial obstacles are the number one challenge our students face in achieving their educational goals. More than 40% of our students are eligible for the federal Pell Grant program. That means that they are coming from families who are living at or below the poverty line. Over 80% of Mt. SAC students receive some form of financial aid. With such great need, it is clear that for Mt. SAC students, a scholarship award can be the difference between being enrolled in college, or not. $1,697,900 total dollars raised in 2020 394 scholarships awarded 1014 donors gave their support 88 Mt. SAC programs supported Together, we all reach new heights. BOARD RESOURCESEVENTSCOMMUNITY CONNECTIONSCONTACT US Stay Connected! Sign up to receive news and updates.

Financial Aid Financial Aid is intended to help students who might not otherwise be able to attend college.

In achieving this goal, the aid office must evaluate the family's financial ability to pay for educational costs in order to distribute limited resources in a fair and equitable manner.

LiveWhale Calendar is a full-featured web calendaring solution used by colleges and universities around the world. It's designed to meet all the calendaring needs of educational institutions like yours, right out of the box. Take a Test Drive We have over 300 users in our system, most of which are not tech savvy, but none have had problems entering events after just one training session. Despite this ease of use, the calendar has all of the features that we were looking for. Erick Beck Texas A&M University Events show up on our webpages in a neat, clean way that invites people to peruse the site and learn more. I also like the handy, customizable RSVP forms that can be embedded into each event. They enable us to keep track of who has signed up and how many guests to expect. Liz Libby Director of Communications, Lake Forest College The frequent compliments we receive about the new calendar’s look and functionality affirm that our decision to switch to LiveWhale was a good one. Katie Monfet Eastern Florida State College THANK YOU for your hard work and smart thinking to get us to launch day with our brand-new calendar. We are incredibly proud to have this calendar as part of our big reveal of the college’s new website, and you have done an amazing job at combining form, function, and fast. Caroline Deveau Director of Digital Communications, Trinity College Our Customers include these great schools and many others. Why LiveWhale Calendar? Because your campus is beautiful, and your calendar should be too. People have a built-in incentive to use calendars, because they have events they want to promote. Take a look at your own calendar. Does it look like an effective tool for event promotion? The fact is, people who are promoting events want them to look great. They post events to Facebook because that may be the easiest way to reach a community, but also because they can add images, descriptions, and videos. Because your calendar can tell a real story of what life is like at your school. So much great stuff happens on your campus every day: performances, lectures, demonstrations, sporting events, pie-eating contests. You know that when prospective students visit campus, they’re twice as likely to apply. So why not you use your campus calendar to project a real sense of how amazing it is to be at your school? Because you need a calendar that integrates with the products and services you already use. We offer easy, seamless integrations with products like EMS, 25Live, OrgSync, Google Calendar, and RSS/ICAL/JSON feeds, so your users never have to enter their events more than once. When you link other calendars to LiveWhale Calendar, the dates and times stay in sync— but you can edit anything else you like. Sometimes awesome events have boring metadata; LiveWhale Calendar lets you take care of that.

White Whale We’re a design, strategy, and technology firm serving colleges and universities around the world. Updates Telling Stories in a Pandemic Design We design and develop websites, brands, print marketing materials, user experiences, and big ideas. Beloit College Ursinus College Anatomy of a Whale: Design. Jason, Tonya, and Sacha discuss how we approach the design process at White Whale. Strategy With two decades of experience in higher education, there aren’t many challenges we haven’t faced before. Marlboro College Randolph College Anatomy of a Whale: Strategy. White Whale began life as a design and technology firm that couldn’t stop thinking about strategy. Now we’re a strategy firm too. Here’s how it all fits together. Technology We are the developers of LiveWhale Calendar, a powerful and flexible web calendaring solution, and the LiveWhale content management platform. We build tools that are easy and fun for the people who use them most: the staff, faculty, and students who make your school a great place to learn. LiveWhale Calendar LiveWhale CMS Anatomy of a Whale: Technology. We build content management and calendaring software that lets colleges and universities tell their story better— and allows everyone on your campus to contribute. Our Clients Here are some of the colleges and universities we’ve worked with on redesigns, and CMS or calendar implementations: Our Team We’re a small, dedicated team of creative problem solvers working from home offices in Oregon, California, New York, Nevada, Michigan, and Florida. Jessica Brown Jessica is obsessed with learning new things and helping people. Prior to joining White Whale, she has worked selling cruises, starting a food truck, and helming a funeral home. She’s happy marrying her love of computers with her passion for helping others as a developer in support, and outside of work, she is a sports fanatic who cares for her own Gus, a French Bulldog. Karl Hinze Karl is all about bringing people together to make beautiful things. Besides being a designer and programmer in his own right, Karl also has extensive experience in higher ed as a student, faculty, and staff member. Outside of White Whale, Karl is a musical theatre composer, where he continues to feed his love of collaboration, art, and storytelling. Tonya Langford Moyle On top of managing White Whale’s business affairs, Tonya works with clients on top-level branding and communications strategy – helping them get past organizational roadblocks and find ways to present web content to make sense to their multiple audiences. Raised in small-town Wisconsin, she headed east to attend Wellesley and then Brown, and then west to Portland, OR where she juggles work, kids, chickens, and a side-gig making napkins for her sister’s restaurant. Alex Romanovich Alex has been indispensable to White Whale since its inception, becoming a permanent full-time employee in 2004 and taking the lead in the development of LiveWhale, our content management system. He is a graduate of NYU’s film and psychology programs, an active writer and photographer, and a student of metaphysics. Isaac McGowan Isaac writes front-end code for the LiveWhale CMS, assists with other CMS implementations, and backs up our UI development team. He has developed and managed web applications since 1999, working on corporate teams as well as individually. Isaac lives in San Rafael with his wife and sons; his non-code interests include surfing, capoeira, and burritos. Katie Compo A compulsive list maker and professional organizer, it’s Katie’s job to shepherd projects from start to finish. She makes sure everything is on track, on budget and everyone is happy. She holds a Bachelor’s from Alma College and a Master’s from Michigan State University. In her free time, you can find Katie with a camera around her neck or enjoying the outdoors with her husband and dog. Lisa Vinson Lisa is a web developer with a passion for using code to find technical solutions to everyday problems. With previous careers education and human resources, her experience in helping people began long before she learned to code. A graduate of the University of Florida, she holds a B.A. in Sociology as well as an M.S. in Human Resources Management from Tarleton State University. When she is not in front of a computer, Lisa enjoys watching all things Gators sports and spending time outdoors. Naomi Royall Naomi enjoys collaborating closely with designers to create elegant, versatile websites. At White Whale, she leads the buildout of our site designs and works to move LiveWhale’s feature set forward. Naomi is British – she moved to Berkeley to study Astrophysics and stayed in California. Outside of coding, she enjoys running, climbing and mountain camping trips. Jason Pontius A pathological multitasker, Jason is involved in every aspect of the website development process – from collaborating with our senior designer on design work to overseeing the care and feeding of the LiveWhale CMS. Jason first began exploring interactive design in 1997 as a complement to his graduate study in linguistics at the University of Chicago (where he holds a master’s degree). Sacha Webley As the lead designer for White Whale, Sacha works with clients to shape beautiful and usable experiences for the web. Born and raised in Oregon, Sacha left the state to study at Stanford University, where he received a BA in Art and Art History. A father of three small children, he now lives on a farm outside of Portland with his family, chickens, cat, books and oil painting studio. LiveWhale Calendar is amazing. We’ve run both in-house and competitor products over the years, but we keep returning to LiveWhale because it works. It’s a rare example of something that just does exactly what it says on the tin. It’s been a quiet workhorse of our site, and our experience has been nothing but positive. We worked with the team at the University of Melbourne to implement a fully custom calendar, designed by the UoM team, using LiveWhale Calendar. White Whale managed what could be considered a complete cultural transformation of our communications in a gentle, collaborative, and dynamic way that left all of us saying to ourselves – How can we find a way to continue to work with these smart, thoughtful, empathetic and highly creative people? We redesigned the COA website, which took home the CASE Gold Circle of Excellence award as the best higher ed site in America. Under intense pressure, White Whale managed to make our project fun. The WW team is a true Captain-Planet-style cast of characters… they all have their own areas of expertise, but it’s magical when their powers combine. Everyone we worked with was responsive, efficient, enthusiastic and relentlessly imaginative. I would recommend White Whale to anyone. We helped Monmouth College launch a brand new website from the ground up using LiveWhale CMS, including full-site architecture and design. Our users and developers love how flexible the calendar has been. The LiveWhale developers are very responsive, extremely helpful and always going the extra mile to land on a solid solution. Overall, LiveWhale is flexible, easy to use, and a pleasure to work with. We worked with Brown to revamp their campus events calendar, run on LiveWhale Calendar and fully customized by Leticia and the team at Brown. As a new institution to LiveWhale, the CMS is great, but what has been more valuable to us so far was the work of the White Whale staff: understanding who we are, building out a site which communicates that, and guiding us to use our new website to the fullest. We redesigned the Beloit College website, which now runs on LiveWhale CMS, and continue to serve as strategic communications consultants. Have a great idea swimming in your head? We can help set it free. Call us (510) 808-4028 Email us hello@whitewhale.net

New Parking Structures: Mostly Empty & with EV Charging October 04, 2021 - 04:20 PM Students now have two mostly empty parking structures to use, on the south side of Temple Ave. on Bonita Dr., and 59 EV (electric vehicle) car charging stations they may use for free in those structures. The structures are both located off Bonita Dr. on the south side of Temple Ave. “Since coming down here, I have spent zero dollars on gas,“ said Aviation student Noah Lehman, who moved from Santa Cruz to attend Mt. SAC. Lehman had an SUV that he sold to buy the plug-in hybrid he now uses in Southern California. Lehman said using the charging stations is incredibly easy. “You just download the app onto your phone and scan it, and then plug in your car. It takes about 30 extra seconds. Plus, these are fast chargers.” Although a student, staff or day use ($4) parking permit is required to use the two parking structures, the EV charging stations are free to use only for students and employees of Mt. SAC. Students and employees may charge their vehicles for up to four hours a day. While availability of parking (or lack thereof) is commonly one of the primary grievances of students to Mt. SAC, these two structures are still mostly empty. This is thought by staff to be because students still do not know about them and lower in-person enrollment, due to the pandemic driving students to online classes or delaying their education altogether until the pandemic ends. But for the students who are using them, they could not be happier. Hear from them in this video about the return of students to the campus. The Champion Structure (or Lot R), which stands next to the Hilmer Lodge Stadium, is now complete and in full use, with new tennis courts and more parking sharing the top level. The Gateway Structure (or Lot S ) is located on the southwest corner of Temple Ave. and Bonita Dr. All levels of that structure are currently in use; however, construction is still being done on the structure. A covered bridge will take students from the structure, over Temple Ave. and into a new Transit Center that is being built on the north side of the street. Another bridge is also under construction to take students over Bonita Dr. to the new Gym and Aquatic Center, which are currently under construction. Since the elevators in Gateway are not yet in use, the first floor of that structure is currently reserved for handicapped parking. Except for the top levels of the two structures, the parking in them is completely covered and will keep cars cool on sunny days and dry on rainy ones. The structures are rarely more than half full at any given time, with Champion currently seeing more use from athletes and Kinesiology students. The Gateway Structure is frequently quite empty on levels 2-4. On a Wednesday late in the morning, the only car on the entire third floor was an electric one using an EV charging station.

The Champion Structure (or Lot R), which stands next to the Hilmer Lodge Stadium, is now complete and in full use, with new tennis courts and more parking sharing the top level. The Gateway Structure (or Lot S ) is located on the southwest corner of Temple Ave. and Bonita Dr. All levels of that structure are currently in use; however, construction is still being done on the structure. A covered bridge will take students from the structure, over Temple Ave. and into a new Transit Center that is being built on the north side of the street. Another bridge is also under construction to take students over Bonita Dr. to the new Gym and Aquatic Center, which are currently under construction. Since the elevators in Gateway are not yet in use, the first floor of that structure is currently reserved for handicapped parking. Except for the top levels of the two structures, the parking in them is completely covered and will keep cars cool on sunny days and dry on rainy ones. The structures are rarely more than half full at any given time, with Champion currently seeing more use from athletes and Kinesiology students. The Gateway Structure is frequently quite empty on levels 2-4. On a Wednesday late in the morning, the only car on the entire third floor was an electric one using an EV charging station.

New Parking Structures: Mostly Empty & with EV Charging October 04, 2021 - 04:20 PM Students now have two mostly empty parking structures to use, on the south side of Temple Ave. on Bonita Dr., and 59 EV (electric vehicle) car charging stations they may use for free in those structures. The structures are both located off Bonita Dr. on the south side of Temple Ave. “Since coming down here, I have spent zero dollars on gas,“ said Aviation student Noah Lehman, who moved from Santa Cruz to attend Mt. SAC. Lehman had an SUV that he sold to buy the plug-in hybrid he now uses in Southern California. Lehman said using the charging stations is incredibly easy. “You just download the app onto your phone and scan it, and then plug in your car. It takes about 30 extra seconds. Plus, these are fast chargers.” Although a student, staff or day use ($4) parking permit is required to use the two parking structures, the EV charging stations are free to use only for students and employees of Mt. SAC. Students and employees may charge their vehicles for up to four hours a day. While availability of parking (or lack thereof) is commonly one of the primary grievances of students to Mt. SAC, these two structures are still mostly empty.

The Gateway Structure (or Lot S ) is located on the southwest corner of Temple Ave. and Bonita Dr. All levels of that structure are currently in use; however, construction is still being done on the structure. A covered bridge will take students from the structure, over Temple Ave. and into a new Transit Center that is being built on the north side of the street. Another bridge is also under construction to take students over Bonita Dr. to the new Gym and Aquatic Center, which are currently under construction. Since the elevators in Gateway are not yet in use, the first floor of that structure is currently reserved for handicapped parking. Except for the top levels of the two structures, the parking in them is completely covered and will keep cars cool on sunny days and dry on rainy ones. The structures are rarely more than half full at any given time, with Champion currently seeing more use from athletes and Kinesiology students. The Gateway Structure is frequently quite empty on levels 2-4. On a Wednesday late in the morning, the only car on the entire third floor was an electric one using an EV charging station.

New Parking Structures: Mostly Empty & with EV Charging October 04, 2021 - 04:20 PM Students now have two mostly empty parking structures to use, on the south side of Temple Ave. on Bonita Dr., and 59 EV (electric vehicle) car charging stations they may use for free in those structures. The structures are both located off Bonita Dr. on the south side of Temple Ave. “Since coming down here, I have spent zero dollars on gas,“ said Aviation student Noah Lehman, who moved from Santa Cruz to attend Mt. SAC. Lehman had an SUV that he sold to buy the plug-in hybrid he now uses in Southern California. Lehman said using the charging stations is incredibly easy. “You just download the app onto your phone and scan it, and then plug in your car. It takes about 30 extra seconds. Plus, these are fast chargers.” Although a student, staff or day use ($4) parking permit is required to use the two parking structures, the EV charging stations are free to use only for students and employees of Mt. SAC. Students and employees may charge their vehicles for up to four hours a day. While availability of parking (or lack thereof) is commonly one of the primary grievances of students to Mt. SAC, these two structures are still mostly empty. This is thought by staff to be because students still do not know about them and lower in-person enrollment, due to the pandemic driving students to online classes or delaying their education altogether until the pandemic ends.

PHOTO EPIC - Café 91 Reopens September 21, 2021 - 09:16 AM Following three semesters and 17 months of campus closure, Café 91, the student-run restaurant located in the first floor of Building 78, has reopened with a much more affordable menu. Café 91 is run by Culinary students, front of house and back, for the advanced class: Culinary 91. One day, students may be on the grill, while the next they are putting the finishing touches on plates before they go out to the dining room. Note the photo reference of dishes supplied by Chef Shelley Doonan, the professor in charge of Café 91 this semester. The supervisors of the work experience class are Lab Techs Marianne Lima and Margaret Speak. Chef Doonan Looks on as the Café 91 Signature Burger comes up, ready for its final touches. As we mentioned, the menu is much more affordable. This mighty double burger, with a choice of house-made chips or side salad, will set you back $7. Not surprisingly, it's a hit with customers. Table seating is limited to 4 people per table. Plan for a leisurely lunch, as service may take about an hour. Adding the cheese to the burger. The professional kitchen at Café 91 is the same as you might see at a popular sit down chain restaurant. The Bahn Mi sandwich ($7) is another good choice for lunch. It's made with pork loin, sambal aioli, cucumber, and pickled vegetables. Your choice of chips or salad. The menu covers a variety of international dishes. This is the Schnitzel, served over a bed of spätzle. But we are getting ahead of ourselves here. The menu also has three starters to choose from: Cauliflower Tempura, Hummus Platter and Chicken Mulitas (each $5). The Mulitas being prepared. After a filling lunch, you might need a little wake-me-up. And Café 91 has a full Espresso Bar, manned by students learning front of house duties. Culinary faculty believe that by gaining experience waiting on tables, busing, hosting etc., the future chefs they train will have valuable insight into how to best serve customers. New for this semester, and in consideration for COVID-19, Café 91 is offering takeout. The host phone (909-274-6243) will be staffed Tues./Wed./Thurs. from 11:15am – 1:15pm to place same-day takeout orders. Payment is collected at time of pickup. Takeout orders may be eaten on the patio. Café 91 is open for lunch Tues, Wed., and Thurs. 11:30am – 1:30pm. Reservations are required. Visit their webpage to get your table. Your cash isn't good here: Credit/debit only (Visa, Mastercard, Discover). These students are training to be chefs and the logistics of cash-handling is not usually part of their profession. Chef Doonan (middle) looks forward to seeing her students move on to chef at popular restaurants throughout Southern California.

Proposed Adult Education Pre-Apprenticeship Program Wins Prize September 16, 2021 - 11:31 AM A proposed adult education healthcare pre-apprenticeship program titled “Mt. SAC Health Careers for You” was named one of four runners-up in the nationwide Rethink Adult Ed Challenge and earned a $100,000 prize. Through the challenge, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education aimed to address equity and access barriers and drive greater and more diverse participation in apprenticeships and the broader workforce, according to the Challenge’s website. High-quality adult education pre-apprenticeship programs align to industry demand, set clear pathways into apprenticeships and other industry roles, and provide support services for their participants. Mt. SAC’s proposed healthcare noncredit pre-apprenticeship focuses on three program areas: Personal Care Aide to Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), with the options of Acute CNA or Home Health Aide, to Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN) to Registered Nurse (RN); Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) to Paramedic to Fire Technology (Firefighter); and Medical Assistant. “We chose to focus on health careers for this competition as it is one of our strongest career paths and students can go right into credit programs if they wish, or learn more intensive skills to enhance their career opportunities,” said Dr. Tami Pearson, Dean of the School of Continuing Education and Workforce Development. “This is a chance to do something different and build pre-apprenticeships into great opportunities for our students.” As part of the program, students will gain skills in math and English contextualized to health careers, foundational theory, and hands-on clinical experience to prepare for immediate employment and entrance into apprenticeship programs. They will benefit from a health careers simulation lab, internships with healthcare facilities, faculty with industry expertise, and ongoing support services. The competition was a two-stage application process, with 203 applications from adult education providers nationwide applying during Stage I. Among those applicants, 95 were invited to participate in a “virtual accelerator,” to further develop plans and submit a Stage II application. The judging panel selected five winning designs out of 85 submissions from across 31 states, Guam and the District of Columbia. “Mt. SAC was the only adult education provider in California to be selected for this honor,” said Dr. Madelyn Arballo, Provost of the School of Continuing Education. “We're so proud of our SCE team for such a huge honor and how it reflects the importance of noncredit career education, in this case our health careers programs, for our community of diverse adult learners.” News New Parking Structures: Mostly Empty & with EV Charging VIDEO: 75th Anniversary In Pandemic, Hundreds of Students Still Come from Abroad 75th Anniversary Diamond Jubilee to be held Oct. 8 PHOTO EPIC - Café 91 Reopens VIDEO: The Return of Students Proposed Adult Education Pre-Apprenticeship Program Wins Prize VIDEO: COVID-19 Testing Centers on Campus CDC Offering Free Food Program $3.3 Million in Student Fees Forgiven 1100 N.

$3.3 Million in Student Fees Forgiven September 03, 2021 - 09:08 AM After 18 months of having to deal with the challenges of the pandemic, students have some good news heading their way: The college is forgiving outstanding fee balances to the tune of $3.3 million. About 4,200 students, who attended from Fall 2014 to Spring 2021, will have their balances wiped out thanks to the use of federal Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds and other district funds. “Many of our students have had significant challenges caused by the pandemic, including losing their jobs or living with family members who have faced COVID-related health issues,” said President Bill Scroggins. “We hope doing this will help ease some of the burden. Supporting our students is a top priority.” News New Parking Structures: Mostly Empty & with EV Charging VIDEO: 75th Anniversary In Pandemic, Hundreds of Students Still Come from Abroad 75th Anniversary Diamond Jubilee to be held Oct. 8 PHOTO EPIC - Café 91 Reopens VIDEO: The Return of Students Proposed Adult Education Pre-Apprenticeship Program Wins Prize VIDEO: COVID-19 Testing Centers on Campus CDC Offering Free Food Program $3.3 Million in Student Fees Forgiven 1100 N.

New Parking Structures: Mostly Empty & with EV Charging October 04, 2021 - 04:20 PM Students now have two mostly empty parking structures to use, on the south side of Temple Ave. on Bonita Dr., and 59 EV (electric vehicle) car charging stations they may use for free in those structures. The structures are both located off Bonita Dr. on the south side of Temple Ave. “Since coming down here, I have spent zero dollars on gas,“ said Aviation student Noah Lehman, who moved from Santa Cruz to attend Mt. SAC. Lehman had an SUV that he sold to buy the plug-in hybrid he now uses in Southern California. Lehman said using the charging stations is incredibly easy. “You just download the app onto your phone and scan it, and then plug in your car. It takes about 30 extra seconds. Plus, these are fast chargers.” Although a student, staff or day use ($4) parking permit is required to use the two parking structures, the EV charging stations are free to use only for students and employees of Mt. SAC. Students and employees may charge their vehicles for up to four hours a day. While availability of parking (or lack thereof) is commonly one of the primary grievances of students to Mt. SAC, these two structures are still mostly empty. This is thought by staff to be because students still do not know about them and lower in-person enrollment, due to the pandemic driving students to online classes or delaying their education altogether until the pandemic ends. But for the students who are using them, they could not be happier. Hear from them in this video about the return of students to the campus. The Champion Structure (or Lot R), which stands next to the Hilmer Lodge Stadium, is now complete and in full use, with new tennis courts and more parking sharing the top level. The Gateway Structure (or Lot S ) is located on the southwest corner of Temple Ave. and Bonita Dr. All levels of that structure are currently in use; however, construction is still being done on the structure. A covered bridge will take students from the structure, over Temple Ave. and into a new Transit Center that is being built on the north side of the street. Another bridge is also under construction to take students over Bonita Dr. to the new Gym and Aquatic Center, which are currently under construction. Since the elevators in Gateway are not yet in use, the first floor of that structure is currently reserved for handicapped parking. Except for the top levels of the two structures, the parking in them is completely covered and will keep cars cool on sunny days and dry on rainy ones. The structures are rarely more than half full at any given time, with Champion currently seeing more use from athletes and Kinesiology students. The Gateway Structure is frequently quite empty on levels 2-4. On a Wednesday late in the morning, the only car on the entire third floor was an electric one using an EV charging station.

New Parking Structures: Mostly Empty & with EV Charging October 04, 2021 - 04:20 PM Students now have two mostly empty parking structures to use, on the south side of Temple Ave. on Bonita Dr., and 59 EV (electric vehicle) car charging stations they may use for free in those structures. The structures are both located off Bonita Dr. on the south side of Temple Ave. “Since coming down here, I have spent zero dollars on gas,“ said Aviation student Noah Lehman, who moved from Santa Cruz to attend Mt. SAC. Lehman had an SUV that he sold to buy the plug-in hybrid he now uses in Southern California. Lehman said using the charging stations is incredibly easy. “You just download the app onto your phone and scan it, and then plug in your car. It takes about 30 extra seconds. Plus, these are fast chargers.” Although a student, staff or day use ($4) parking permit is required to use the two parking structures, the EV charging stations are free to use only for students and employees of Mt. SAC. Students and employees may charge their vehicles for up to four hours a day. While availability of parking (or lack thereof) is commonly one of the primary grievances of students to Mt. SAC, these two structures are still mostly empty. This is thought by staff to be because students still do not know about them and lower in-person enrollment, due to the pandemic driving students to online classes or delaying their education altogether until the pandemic ends. But for the students who are using them, they could not be happier. Hear from them in this video about the return of students to the campus. The Champion Structure (or Lot R), which stands next to the Hilmer Lodge Stadium, is now complete and in full use, with new tennis courts and more parking sharing the top level. The Gateway Structure (or Lot S ) is located on the southwest corner of Temple Ave. and Bonita Dr. All levels of that structure are currently in use; however, construction is still being done on the structure. A covered bridge will take students from the structure, over Temple Ave. and into a new Transit Center that is being built on the north side of the street. Another bridge is also under construction to take students over Bonita Dr. to the new Gym and Aquatic Center, which are currently under construction. Since the elevators in Gateway are not yet in use, the first floor of that structure is currently reserved for handicapped parking. Except for the top levels of the two structures, the parking in them is completely covered and will keep cars cool on sunny days and dry on rainy ones. The structures are rarely more than half full at any given time, with Champion currently seeing more use from athletes and Kinesiology students. The Gateway Structure is frequently quite empty on levels 2-4. On a Wednesday late in the morning, the only car on the entire third floor was an electric one using an EV charging station.

New Parking Structures: Mostly Empty & with EV Charging October 04, 2021 - 04:20 PM Students now have two mostly empty parking structures to use, on the south side of Temple Ave. on Bonita Dr., and 59 EV (electric vehicle) car charging stations they may use for free in those structures. The structures are both located off Bonita Dr. on the south side of Temple Ave. “Since coming down here, I have spent zero dollars on gas,“ said Aviation student Noah Lehman, who moved from Santa Cruz to attend Mt. SAC. Lehman had an SUV that he sold to buy the plug-in hybrid he now uses in Southern California. Lehman said using the charging stations is incredibly easy. “You just download the app onto your phone and scan it, and then plug in your car. It takes about 30 extra seconds. Plus, these are fast chargers.” Although a student, staff or day use ($4) parking permit is required to use the two parking structures, the EV charging stations are free to use only for students and employees of Mt. SAC. Students and employees may charge their vehicles for up to four hours a day. While availability of parking (or lack thereof) is commonly one of the primary grievances of students to Mt. SAC, these two structures are still mostly empty. This is thought by staff to be because students still do not know about them and lower in-person enrollment, due to the pandemic driving students to online classes or delaying their education altogether until the pandemic ends. But for the students who are using them, they could not be happier. Hear from them in this video about the return of students to the campus. The Champion Structure (or Lot R), which stands next to the Hilmer Lodge Stadium, is now complete and in full use, with new tennis courts and more parking sharing the top level. The Gateway Structure (or Lot S ) is located on the southwest corner of Temple Ave. and Bonita Dr. All levels of that structure are currently in use; however, construction is still being done on the structure. A covered bridge will take students from the structure, over Temple Ave. and into a new Transit Center that is being built on the north side of the street. Another bridge is also under construction to take students over Bonita Dr. to the new Gym and Aquatic Center, which are currently under construction. Since the elevators in Gateway are not yet in use, the first floor of that structure is currently reserved for handicapped parking. Except for the top levels of the two structures, the parking in them is completely covered and will keep cars cool on sunny days and dry on rainy ones. The structures are rarely more than half full at any given time, with Champion currently seeing more use from athletes and Kinesiology students. The Gateway Structure is frequently quite empty on levels 2-4. On a Wednesday late in the morning, the only car on the entire third floor was an electric one using an EV charging station.

In Pandemic, Hundreds of Students Still Come from Abroad September 29, 2021 - 12:02 AM Despite the difficulty in overseas travel, more than 300 international students have come from abroad to attend Mt. SAC in-person this Fall. As expected, COVID-19, and the restrictions and guidelines surrounding international travel, have dipped the numbers this school year, but perhaps not nearly as much as one might expect. The International Student Center held a Welcome Carnival for these on-campus students from such distant locales as Myanmar and the Ivory Coast. The Carnival was a meet and greet for International Students to get to know each other in hopes they help support one another with the cultural, language and educational challenges they will face traveling so far from home to attend college. The most popular destination from which Mt. SAC draws students is China, and the most popular major for international students is Business, according to Christopher Dickson, the new Director of the International Student Program. All over campus, in a wide array of majors, students from a diverse number of countries, such as Indonesia, Taiwan, India, and Brazil are studying hard to take advantage of the cache that an American education holds within the global job market. “Having a degree from an American institution holds weight and is very marketable,” Dickson said. “A community college like Mt. SAC is seen worldwide as a great way to segue to an American four-year university. Plus, it costs significantly less, so they are saving money transferring to them instead.” The Carnival invites campus clubs to host games for the students in order to get them to join and be more involved in college social life. The idea is to develop a sense of community and belonging in students who otherwise may feel a bit alienated on such a large campus in a foreign country. But building a sense of community goes both ways for the International Student Program, said Dickson, “Our signature event each year is the International Fair during the International Education Week in November.” At the upcoming fair, international students will host informational booths about their countries for purposes of cultural exchange and appreciation. This educates other students about their culture, while at the same time building awareness of the large international presence on the campus, Dickson said.

In Pandemic, Hundreds of Students Still Come from Abroad September 29, 2021 - 12:02 AM Despite the difficulty in overseas travel, more than 300 international students have come from abroad to attend Mt. SAC in-person this Fall. As expected, COVID-19, and the restrictions and guidelines surrounding international travel, have dipped the numbers this school year, but perhaps not nearly as much as one might expect. The International Student Center held a Welcome Carnival for these on-campus students from such distant locales as Myanmar and the Ivory Coast. The Carnival was a meet and greet for International Students to get to know each other in hopes they help support one another with the cultural, language and educational challenges they will face traveling so far from home to attend college. The most popular destination from which Mt. SAC draws students is China, and the most popular major for international students is Business, according to Christopher Dickson, the new Director of the International Student Program. All over campus, in a wide array of majors, students from a diverse number of countries, such as Indonesia, Taiwan, India, and Brazil are studying hard to take advantage of the cache that an American education holds within the global job market. “Having a degree from an American institution holds weight and is very marketable,” Dickson said. “A community college like Mt. SAC is seen worldwide as a great way to segue to an American four-year university. Plus, it costs significantly less, so they are saving money transferring to them instead.” The Carnival invites campus clubs to host games for the students in order to get them to join and be more involved in college social life. The idea is to develop a sense of community and belonging in students who otherwise may feel a bit alienated on such a large campus in a foreign country. But building a sense of community goes both ways for the International Student Program, said Dickson, “Our signature event each year is the International Fair during the International Education Week in November.” At the upcoming fair, international students will host informational booths about their countries for purposes of cultural exchange and appreciation. This educates other students about their culture, while at the same time building awareness of the large international presence on the campus, Dickson said.

The Carnival was a meet and greet for International Students to get to know each other in hopes they help support one another with the cultural, language and educational challenges they will face traveling so far from home to attend college. The most popular destination from which Mt. SAC draws students is China, and the most popular major for international students is Business, according to Christopher Dickson, the new Director of the International Student Program. All over campus, in a wide array of majors, students from a diverse number of countries, such as Indonesia, Taiwan, India, and Brazil are studying hard to take advantage of the cache that an American education holds within the global job market. “Having a degree from an American institution holds weight and is very marketable,” Dickson said. “A community college like Mt. SAC is seen worldwide as a great way to segue to an American four-year university. Plus, it costs significantly less, so they are saving money transferring to them instead.” The Carnival invites campus clubs to host games for the students in order to get them to join and be more involved in college social life. The idea is to develop a sense of community and belonging in students who otherwise may feel a bit alienated on such a large campus in a foreign country. But building a sense of community goes both ways for the International Student Program, said Dickson, “Our signature event each year is the International Fair during the International Education Week in November.” At the upcoming fair, international students will host informational booths about their countries for purposes of cultural exchange and appreciation. This educates other students about their culture, while at the same time building awareness of the large international presence on the campus, Dickson said.
